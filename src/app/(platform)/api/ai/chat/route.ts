    cleanser: "🧴 Choose a gentle cleanser for your skin type: gel cleansers for oily skin, cream cleansers for dry skin, and micellar water for sensitive skin. Cleanse twice daily - morning and evening.",

    moisturizer: "💧 Moisturizer is essential for all skin types! Even oily skin needs hydration. Look for lightweight, oil-free formulas for oily skin, and richer creams for dry skin. Apply to damp skin for better absorption.",

    sunscreen: "☀️ SPF 30+ daily is non-negotiable! Apply 15-30 minutes before sun exposure. Reapply every 2 hours. Physical sunscreens (zinc oxide/titanium dioxide) are best for sensitive skin.",

    // Ingredient-specific responses
    retinol: "🌙 Start with 0.25-0.5% retinol 2-3x/week at night. Gradually increase frequency. Always use sunscreen during the day. May cause initial dryness - this is normal! Great for anti-aging and acne.",

    "vitamin c": "🍊 Vitamin C serums brighten skin and provide antioxidant protection. Use in the morning under sunscreen. Start with 10-15% concentration. L-ascorbic acid is most potent but can be irritating for sensitive skin.",

    niacinamide: "✨ Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) reduces oil production, minimizes pores, and calms inflammation. Great for oily/acne-prone skin. Can be used AM/PM. Generally well-tolerated by all skin types.",

    hyaluronic: "💦 Hyaluronic acid holds 1000x its weight in water! Apply to damp skin, then seal with moisturizer. Perfect for all skin types. Use morning and evening for maximum hydration boost.",

    salicylic: "🧪 Salicylic acid (BHA) penetrates pores to clear blackheads and whiteheads. Start 2-3x/week. Use sunscreen as it increases photosensitivity. Great for oily/acne-prone skin.",

    // Skin conditions
    acne: "🎯 For acne: gentle cleanser + salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide + oil-free moisturizer + sunscreen. Don't over-cleanse! Be patient - results take 6-12 weeks. Consider seeing a dermatologist for severe acne.",

    "dry skin": "🥛 Dry skin needs: gentle cream cleanser + hydrating toner + hyaluronic acid serum + rich moisturizer + gentle exfoliation 1-2x/week. Avoid harsh scrubs and over-washing.",

    "oily skin": "🧽 Oily skin routine: gel cleanser + BHA/salicylic acid + lightweight moisturizer + broad-spectrum SPF. Don't skip moisturizer - dehydrated skin produces more oil!",

    sensitive: "🌸 Sensitive skin needs: fragrance-free, gentle products. Patch test everything! Look for ceramides, niacinamide, and avoid essential oils, alcohol, and harsh actives.",

    // Age-specific advice
    "anti-aging": "🕰️ Anti-aging essentials: retinol/retinoids, vitamin C, sunscreen, moisturizer with peptides. Start early with prevention! Consistency is key - results take 3-6 months.",

    wrinkles: "📏 For wrinkles: retinol at night, vitamin C in morning, peptide moisturizer, daily SPF. Consider professional treatments like Botox or dermal fillers for deeper lines.",

    // Product recommendations
    drugstore: "🏪 Great drugstore options: CeraVe (moisturizers), The Ordinary (serums), Neutrogena (sunscreen), Paula's Choice (BHA). You don't need expensive products for great skin!",

    korean: "🇰🇷 K-beauty favorites: double cleansing, essences, sheet masks, snail mucin (healing), centella asiatica (soothing). Focus on hydration and gentle ingredients.",

    // Routine building
    routine: "📋 Basic routine: AM - cleanser, vitamin C serum, moisturizer, SPF. PM - cleanser, treatment (retinol/acid), moisturizer. Add products slowly and patch test!",

    order: "1️⃣ Product order: cleanser → toner → serum (thinnest to thickest) → moisturizer → sunscreen (AM only). Wait 10-15 minutes between active ingredients.",

    // Seasonal/climate advice
    winter: "❄️ Winter skincare: switch to cream cleansers, add face oil, use humidifier, don't skip SPF. Cold air and indoor heating can severely dehydrate skin.",

    summer: "🌞 Summer adjustments: lightweight products, extra SPF protection, oil-free formulas, antioxidant serums for pollution protection. Reapply sunscreen frequently!",

    humid: "🌿 Humid climate: gel cleansers, lightweight serums, oil-free moisturizers, waterproof sunscreen. Focus on oil control and frequent cleansing after sweating.",

    // Common mistakes
    mistakes: "❌ Common mistakes: over-cleansing, skipping moisturizer on oily skin, not using SPF daily, introducing too many products at once, not patch testing, expecting overnight results.",

    // Professional advice
    dermatologist: "👩‍⚕️ See a dermatologist for: persistent acne, suspicious moles, severe skin conditions, prescription treatments, or if over-the-counter products aren't working after 3 months.",
